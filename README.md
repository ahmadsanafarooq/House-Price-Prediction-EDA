🔍 **Exploring House Price Data: Key Insights & Visualizations** 🏠  

As part of my  data analysis project, I dived deep into a **House Price Prediction Dataset** to explore factors influencing property prices, visualize trends, detect outliers, and generate actionable insights. Here's what I found: 

 📊 **1. Data Overview & Quality Checks:**
**Missing Values:** Checked for gaps in data to ensure clean analysis.  
**Duplicate Records:** Identified and removed duplicates for accurate results.  
**Descriptive Statistics:** Summarized key variables like `Area`, `Bedrooms`, and `Price`.  



 🎨 **2. Visualizing Data Distributions**  
**Histograms:** Analyzed the spread of continuous variables such as `Price` and `Area`.  
**Box Plots:** Identified outliers across variables like `Condition` and `Garage`.  
**Scatter Plots:** Explored relationships, such as `Price` vs. `Area`.  
**Pair Plots:** Compared key variables across different locations.

  
🚨 **3. Outlier Detection & Handling**  
Detected outliers in `Price` using the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method.  
Visualized them with **scatter plots** and **violin plots**, highlighting potential anomalies.  


### 🔑 **4. Key Findings:**  
**Condition & Location:** Homes in better condition and prime locations have higher prices.  
**Bedrooms & Bathrooms:** Both significantly influence pricing trends, as seen in boxen plots.  
**Outliers:** While outliers exist, they provide critical insights into premium properties.  


### 🛠 **5. Correlation Heatmap:**  
The heatmap revealed strong correlations between `Area` and `Price`, reinforcing that square footage is a major predictor of house value.  


#### 📸 **Some Visual Highlights:**  
Here’s a snapshot of visualizations created:  
**Price Distribution by Condition:** Shows how property condition impacts pricing.  
**Area vs. Price Scatter Plot:** Outliers highlighted in red.  
**Heatmap of Correlations:** Identifies key relationships.  

This project demonstrates the power of **data visualization and statistical methods** in extracting actionable insights from housing data.
